## üéØ Assumptions Made

1. **Authentication**: Assumed JWT-based authentication with Bearer token in Authorization header
2. **Image Handling**: Assumed property images are stored as URLs and served from a CDN or file server
3. **Geolocation**: Assumed property coordinates are stored as [longitude, latitude] arrays
4. **Pagination**: Assumed backend supports pagination with metadata (total, page, limit, totalPages)
5. **Property Types**: Limited to "rent" and "sale" as the primary property types
6. **Responsive Design**: Designed for desktop-first with mobile responsiveness
7. **Error Handling**: Assumed backend returns consistent error response format

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Choices & Architecture

### Frontend Framework & Language

- **React 19** with **TypeScript**: Chosen for type safety, better developer experience, and modern React features
- **Vite**: Fast build tool with excellent HMR and development experience

### State Management

- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management for UI state (filters, pagination, modals)
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management with caching, background updates, and optimistic updates
- **URL State Sync**: Custom hooks to sync filter state with URL parameters for shareable links

### UI & Styling

- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Radix UI**: Headless UI components for accessibility and customization

- **Custom Component Library**: Built reusable components following design system principles

### Routing & Navigation

- **React Router v7**: Modern routing with lazy loading for code splitting
- **Layout-based Architecture**: Separate layouts for public and admin sections

### Data Fetching & API

- **Axios**: HTTP client with interceptors for authentication and error handling
- **Custom API Layer**: Organized API calls by feature with TypeScript interfaces
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

### Maps & Geolocation

- **Leaflet**: Open-source mapping library for property location display
- **React Leaflet**: React wrapper for Leaflet integration
- **Interactive Map Picker**: Click-to-select location functionality for property creation

### Form Handling

- **Manual State Management**: Custom form state with useState hooks
- **Custom Validation**: Built-in validation with error messaging
- **Image Upload**: Drag-and-drop image upload with preview and management

### Code Organization

- **Feature-based Architecture**: Organized code by business features (properties, inquiries, viewings)
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic extraction for data fetching and UI state
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures

2. **Real-time Chat**: Live chat system between clients and agents

## ‚ö° Shortcuts & Compromises

1. **Mock Data**: Used placeholder data during development when backend wasn't ready
2. **Authentication Infrastructure**: Prepared Axios interceptors for token-based auth but no actual auth system implemented
3. **Placeholder Images**: Used random image generation instead of actual file upload for demo purposes
4. **Simple Error Messages**: Generic error messages instead of specific API error handling
5. **No Unit Tests**: Focused on functionality over test coverage (would add in production)
6. **Basic SEO**: Minimal meta tags and SEO optimization
7. **No PWA Features**: Skipped service worker and offline functionality
8. **Simple State Management**: Used Zustand instead of more complex Redux setup
